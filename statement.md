# Project Statement

This project is a simple Hospital Patient Information Manager created using Python.
The main purpose is to store and manage patient details in a small clinic or hospital using a basic menu-driven program.

## Objectives
- Add patient information
- View stored patient records
- Search patient by ID
- Update patient details
- Delete patient entry
- Save data permanently in a JSON file

## Problem Addressed
Many small hospitals still store patient details on paper, which can cause:
- Loss of important records  
- Difficulty in updating or tracking patient details  
- Human errors  

This project solves this by moving records into a small digital system.

## Scope of the Project
This project is designed for educational use and small-scale clinics. It focuses on:
- Basic CRUD operations  
- Python file handling  
- JSON data storage  

## Future Enhancements
- GUI Interface (Tkinter)
- MySQL / SQLite Database
- Search filters and sorting
- User login system
